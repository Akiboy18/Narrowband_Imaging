# Narrowband_Imaging
__This project performs **false-color imaging** using narrowband data from the **Hubble Space Telescope (HST)** and **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**. Data from the **Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA)** and **MAST Portal** are processed and combined into RGB composites, highlighting specific wavelengths for enhanced visualization of celestial structures.__
---

## Overview  
_This project transforms raw narrowband data from **HST** and **JWST** into stunning **false-color images**, making invisible emission lines visible in RGB composites.  
It helps **astronomy students, researchers, and enthusiasts** visualize ionized gas regions, nebulae, and star-forming areas in a scientifically meaningful yet visually engaging way.  
It exists to bridge the gap between raw scientific data and public-friendly imagery, making astrophysics more accessible and exciting._
